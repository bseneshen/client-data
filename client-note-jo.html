<p><br/><strong>Social History:</strong> Jo is a widowed mother of 4 living in an assisted living facility. Her 4 adult children are all involved in her care; however, her eldest daughter and youngest son live in the same town and alternate visiting her daily.</p>
<p><strong>Employment/work/school:</strong> Retired school teacher</p>
<p><strong>Prior level of function:</strong> Jo has a full-time aide who comes in every morning to help with bathing and dressing and stays with her until one of her children arrives to assist with the nightly routine. The facility provides 3 meals daily.</p>
<p><strong>Living situation/ Environmental barriers:</strong> Jo lives in a continuing care retirement community. She currently resides in assisted living; however, her children and the staff have determined that she requires more care than assisted living is able to provide. She was placed on the wait list for the facility’s memory care unit. Until she is able to transition to the floor, the family hired a full-time aide during the day, and one of her children comes each night.</p>
